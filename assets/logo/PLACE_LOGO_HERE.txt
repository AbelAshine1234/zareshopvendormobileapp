⚠️ IMPORTANT: Add Your ZareShop Logo Here

QUICK STEPS:
1. Save your ZareShop logo (green shopping bag logo) as: logo.png
2. Place it in this folder: assets/logo/logo.png
3. Run: flutter pub get
4. Press R in terminal (capital R for hot restart)

FILE REQUIREMENTS:
- Name: logo.png (exact name)
- Size: 512x200 px or similar (wide format)
- Format: PNG (transparent or white background)

After adding the logo, the app will display it beautifully at full width!

If no logo is added, it will show "ZARE SHOP" text as fallback.
